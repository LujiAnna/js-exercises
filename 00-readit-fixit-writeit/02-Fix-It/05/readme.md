# FIX IT
## EX 05
In this exercise we want every word in a title to start with a capital letter.
* Look at the error message in the dev tools and fix it.
* Look at the documentation of split(). -> stringify string into array of characters
* Look at the documentation of charAt(). -> returns a char at given index
* Look at the documentation of slice(). -> will give a shallow copy of the array
  join() -> concatenates array
* Adjust the function to get the desired result
